Clojure (pronounced /ˈkloʊʒɜr/, like "closure"[3]) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language created by Rich Hickey.[4] Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming.[5] It runs on the Java Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime,[6] and JavaScript[7] engines. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system.[8] The current development process is community-driven,[9] overseen by Rich Hickey as its BDFL.[10]

Clojure takes a modern stance on programming by encouraging immutability and immutable data structures. While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of gradual typing.[11] Clojure encourages programmers to be explicit about managing state and identity.[12] This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs are intended to facilitate the development of more robust programs, particularly multithreaded ones.[13][14]

Clojure is successfully used in industry by companies such as Walmart,[15] Puppet Labs,[16] and other large software companies.[17] Commercial support for Clojure is provided by Cognitect.[17] Annual Clojure conferences are organised every year across the globe, the most famous of them being Clojure/conj (US east coast), Clojure/West (US west coast), and EuroClojure (Europe).

The latest stable version of Clojure is 1.7,[18] released on June 30, 2015. The first stable release was version 1.0, released on May 4, 2009.[19] Clojure is free software released under the Eclipse Public License.[20]
